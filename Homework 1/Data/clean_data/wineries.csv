Highly recommended,  I brought 4 bottles today as I found their wine to be unique and a step above the rest. I hope to see plenty online or overseas in the future. | ------Review Author: Cristi | Rating: 4 | Text: We booked very easily with e-mail, very responsive. The place is conveniently located near Skopje, important winery. The location has multiple attractions for staying and spending time. We had a short tour with explanations on wine making process. Then we had the actual tasting of 5 wines, according to what we chose. The wines were good and nice presentation. We felt hurried to move on wine by wine on the tasting part which was the single negative point, everything took 45 minutes, but overall a good experience. Price was somewhere mid, depending on wine selection, but no appetizers included. By the way, some neutralizer is required, maybe bread only or crackers. | ------Review Author: Olha Kalinina | Rating: 5 | Text: Amazing experience at wine tasting!
